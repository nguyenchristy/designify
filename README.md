Designify is an app that helps users decorate and organize their rooms. With TypeScript and JavaScript for the backend and frontend, this app will utilize the Gemini API to generate interior imagery of the user uploaded image for the user to modify. 

How we’ll use Gemini:
We’ll use Gemini to optimize and place the furniture within the space in the most ideal locations. The user will upload the image, to which we’ll then create a prompt in the back-end that Gemini will run and return back out to the user. 

HOW TO USE:
1. Upload and submit an image of a room to our site.
2. View our adjusted room image 
3. Make necessary changes to the objects.
